🔒 Automated Vulnerability Scanner

Welcome to my project, an automated vulnerability scanner that brings peace of mind to your applications. By harnessing the power of Zap, I've created a streamlined solution that simplifies and automates the process of identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.

⏰ Scheduled Scans for Effortless Protection

Say goodbye to manual scans! With my project, you can easily schedule vulnerability scans to run at your preferred intervals. Simply set it up once, and let the system take care of the rest. Rest easy, knowing that your applications are consistently monitored for potential threats.

🗃️ Simplified Report Management, Just the Way You Like It

I understand the pain of rummaging through folders for scan reports. That's why I've designed a hassle-free report management system. All your reports are stored in one centralized location for easy access. No more time wasted searching - find and review past reports effortlessly.

🌐 Intuitive Web Interface - Visualize and Act

My project comes with a visually appealing web interface. Interact with the program and gain valuable insights into your application's security status. With a few clicks, you can dive deep into scan results, identify vulnerabilities, and take swift actions to fortify your system against potential risks.

🚨 Automatic Alerts for Swift Action

Stay one step ahead with automatic vulnerability alerts! My project notifies you immediately upon the discovery of any security vulnerabilities. Be promptly informed, so you can take swift actions to remediate and patch potential risks, keeping your applications secure at all times.
